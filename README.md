This is an E-Commerce project.
it uses firebase firestore as a backend to store products, users, admins and orders data.
Each user's cart is stored in firebase and is updated once changed.
i used Redux Toolkit for state management.
It has an admin dashboard.
Admins can view all the users and admins.
Admins can view / edit / add / delete all products
Admins can view all the orders
